# Specialized-Tool-To-Assist-In-The-Creation-of-Basic-Object-Oriented-Java-Programs

  This program was developed as the capstone project in my Senior Design class at CSUDH. The main purpose of this program is to offer new programmers a guided introduction to the world of object-oriented programming in Java. Included with the source code is a PDF explaining this in more detail along with some design elements. Also, a video demonstration has been attached to show some of the program's functionalities.
